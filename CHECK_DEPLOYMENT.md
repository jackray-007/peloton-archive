# ✅ Check if Your Site is Working

## How to Check:

### 1. Check Vercel Dashboard

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find**: `peloton-archive` project
3. **Look at the status**:
   - ✅ **"Ready"** or **"Deployed"** = Working!
   - ⏳ **"Building"** = Still deploying (wait 1-2 minutes)
   - ❌ **"Error"** = Something went wrong (check logs)

### 2. Check Your Live URL

If deployment is successful, you'll see a URL like:
- `peloton-archive.vercel.app`
- Or a custom domain if you set one up

**Click the URL** to visit your live site!

### 3. What to Look For

When you visit your site, you should see:
- ✅ Homepage loads
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ Products page works
- ✅ All pages accessible
